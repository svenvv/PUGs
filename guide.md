__**INTRO:**__

PUGs (aka Pick-Up-Games) are games where a group of people come together to play the game competitively. These games are done using the competitive rule-set in custom games to help players practice and have fun without the risk of ones SR. There are many different PUGs for different types of players.

• __**Expectations/Rules:**__
  ○ All players must follow the discord server rules previously stated in #info.
  ○ PUGs are a privilege, not a right. We don't have to run PUGs, be aware that all staff are doing this voluntarily for the community.
  ○ You must be playing on a recently placed account, up to 3 seasons ago, that accurately reflects your skill, no exceptions.
  ○ For official PUG events you must show up with your main account. For unofficial ones this rule is loosened somewhat for those that have multiple accounts they wish to level.
  ○ Your profile must be public to confirm the previous rule and to estimate your skill and hero pool. You will not be allowed to play until it is public.
  ○ Smurfing is not allowed in any way. PUGs are restricted based on SR to make sure the games are fair and fun. Smurfing in SR restricted PUG events WILL get you perma-banned.
  ○ If you are participating in PUGs you are expected to behave well, not doing so can result in mutes, suspensions or a ban:
    - Watch your language; swearing is allowed but slurs of any kind are not.
    - Communication is very important and encourged; we have dedicated voice channels on Discord for PUGs, do not scream into your mic however and ensure your mic is setup correctly.
    - Be a team player; picking "meme-heroes" or forcing your team to play around you isn't what PUGs are about. If you want to play attack Torbjorn on Assault there is Quick Play.
    - Being annoyed at times is okay, being tilted is not. PUGs are ment to be a way to improve yourself and have fun without the risk of losing SR.
    - Do not leave games in progress or rage quit. If you have an unstable internet please to refrain from playing PUGs until you have it fixed. Remember there are 11 other players playing with you.

  ○ When in need of help or when you have a question feel free to ping (@) an online member of PUG staff, do not ping the entire role as this will result in :jaynePing:

Failure to adhere to these rules can results in warnings, suspensions or a ban from all PUGs or even the server.
If you see anyone breaking any rules, you can report this to us by contacting a member of PUG staff or by using the `!report [Discord-tag] [reason]` so we are notified of the situation and can take action.

• __**TYPES OF PUGs:**__

○ __Reverse Beginner PUGs:__
These PUGs are open to all Master+ players and are spectated by Plat- players, this gives an opportunity for lower SR players to watch high SR players and hopefully learn stuff about the game.
○ __Tryhard PUGs:__
These PUGs are open to all players that are Diamond+ and are great for refining your skills on heroes you play a lot of.
○__Mixed PUGs:__
These PUGs are open to all players of all SR and is a great tool to learn heroes you may not be confident on.
○__Beginner PUGs:__
These PUGs are open to all players Gold- and each team is spectated by a coach that will give you advice after every game. Coaches are also voluntary so understand that they have lives as well.
○ __Unofficial PUGs:__
These PUGs are not scheduled and you are allowed to start them at any time. Don't be afraid to talk in chat or hang out in voice and look for people.

• __**How to participate**__

For every official PUG you will be notified when they happen. Jump in the PUG Hangout voice channel and there should be a @PUG STAFF member around to point you in the right direction. If there is no staff available, check the #pug-announcements channel to see if there are directions for you. Otherwise, wait for someone to come to pick you up or tag a @PUG STAFF member for further directions.

You can use the #put-your-bnet-here-please channel to post your battletag so the lobby host can invite you.
Preferred format:
`<BATTLE TAG> for <VOICE CHANNEL>`
ex. `Lunar#11279 NA High`

Sometimes not enough staff members are available to host your lobby. In that case one of the players will have to set up a lobby. Please only volunteer to set up a lobby if you are familiar with changing custom game settings.

To make picking teams easier for captains, you are required to change your in-game player icon to match what you are going to be playing for that game. This is the list of icons/meaning.
- :Shanghai Dragons: = DPS
- :Houston Outlaws: = Tank
- :Florida Mayhem: = Support

• __**Picking Teams:**__
○ __Rules:__
  - You are not allowed to be picked if you join mid draft.
  - If you are not picked in a lobby that has 16- players and is not a Tryhard Lobby you must be picked next game (Does not apply if you join mid draft)

Before a match can start, teams need to be drafted and a map needs to be chosen. This process is done by picking two Captains (team leaders) first. If there are no volunteers for captains the lobby host will pick two players at will. Team Captains are responsible for assembling balanced teams and picking a map. The picking process during official PUGs happens as follows:

```css
[Blue Captain] Picks one player
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks one player
***
[Blue Captain] Bans a map type (Assault, Control, Escort, Hybrid)
[Red Captain] Picks a map type that was not banned
[Blue Captain] Picks two maps from the chosen map type
[Red Captain] Picks a map from the two chosen options
```
