**THIS PAGE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING READ IT TO ANSWER ALL STUPID QUESTIONS**

__**INTRO:**__

PUGs (aka Pick-Up-Games) are games where a group of people come together to play the game competitively. These games are done using the competitive rule-set in custom games to help players practice and have fun without the risk of ones SR. There are many different PUGs for different types of players.

•__**Expectations/Rules:**__
 ○ All players must follow the rules previously stated in #info.
 ○ PUGs are a privilege, not a right. We don't have to run PUGs so don't complain about stuff like that. Be aware that all the staff is voluntarily doing this out of our day.
 ○ You must be playing on a placed account. (10 games of comp aren't that bad so don't whine)
   - Your account must be Public to confirm it is placed. You will not be allowed to get picked if your profile is Private/Friends Only.
 ○ If you are participating in PUGs you are willing to behave well. Not doing so is a quick way to a mute/ban.
   - Watching your language, swearing is allowed but slurs are not.
   - Communicating; No one wants to hear you scream into your mic.
   - Be a team player. Forcing your team to play around you isn't what we are about.
   - Being annoyed is ok. But being tilted is not. These are PUGs, not the ladder, there is no reason to be getting upset. These games are meant to be fun.
   - Not to leave games, if you have an unstable internet please try to not play PUGs until you have it figured it out.
 ○ Smurfing is not allowed in any way, PUGs are restricted based on SR to make sure games are fair and fun. Also, why do you care that you pub stomped some Golds? It only makes you look like a dick.
 ○ Only @ one staff, not the role

If you see anyone breaking any rules, report this to any @PUG STAFF or use the `!report [Discord-tag] [reason]` command so we can take care of the situation.
Any person who fails to meet these criteria is subject to warnings, a suspension or ban from official PUGs.

•__**TYPES OF PUGs:**__

○__Reverse Beginner PUGs:__
These PUGs are open to all Master+ players and are spectated by Plat- players, this gives an opportunity for lower SR players to watch high SR players and hopefully learn stuff about the game.
○__Tryhard PUGs:__
 -These PUGs are open to all players that are Diamond+ and are great for refining your skills on heroes you play a lot of.
○__Mixed PUGs:__

○__Beginner PUGs:__
 -These PUGs are open to all players Gold- and each team is spectated by a coach that will give you advice after every game. Coaches are also voluntary so understand that they have lives as well.
○__Unofficial PUGs:__
 -These PUGs are not scheduled and you are allowed to start them at any time. Don't be afraid to talk in chat or hang out in voice and look for people.

•__**How to participate**__

For every official PUG you will be notified when they happen. Jump in the PUG Hangout voice channel and there should be a @PUG STAFF member around to point you in the right direction. If there is no staff available, check the #pug-announcements channel to see if there are directions for you. Otherwise, wait for someone to come to pick you up or tag a @PUG STAFF member for further directions.

You can use the #put-your-bnet-here-please channel to post your battletag so the lobby host can invite you.
Preferred format:
`<BATTLE TAG> for <VOICE CHANNEL>`
ex. `Lunar#11279 NA High`

Sometimes not enough staff members are available to host your lobby. In that case one of the players will have to set up a lobby. Please only volunteer to set up a lobby if you are familiar with changing custom game settings.

•__**Picking Teams:**__
○__Rules:__
 -You are not allowed to be picked if you join mid draft.
 -If you are not picked in a lobby that has 16- players and is not a Tryhard Lobby you must be picked next game (Does not apply if you join mid draft)
 Before a match can start, teams need to be drafted and a map needs to be chosen. This process is done by picking two Captains (team leaders) first. If there are no volunteers for captains the lobby host will pick two players at will. Team Captains are responsible for assembling balanced teams and picking a map. The picking process during official PUGs happens as follows:

```css
[Blue Captain] Picks one player
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks one player
***
[Blue Captain] Bans a map type (Assault, Control, Escort, Hybrid)
[Red Captain] Picks a map type that was not banned
[Blue Captain] Picks two maps from the chosen map type
[Red Captain] Picks a map from the two chosen options
```
