__**INTRO**__

PUGs (aka Pick-Up-Games) are games where a group of people come together to play the game competitively. These games are done using the competitive rule-set in custom games to help players practice and have fun without the risk of ones SR. There are many different PUGs for different types of players.

__**EXPECTATIONS AND RULES**__
  • All players must follow the discord server rules previously stated in #info.
  • PUGs are a privilege, not a right. We don't have to run PUGs, be aware that all staff are doing this voluntarily for the community.
  • You must be playing on a recently placed account, up to 3 seasons ago, that accurately reflects your skill, no exceptions.
  • For official PUG events you must show up with your main account. For unofficial ones this rule is loosened somewhat for those that have multiple accounts they wish to level.
  • Your profile must be public to confirm the previous rule and to estimate your skill and hero pool. You will not be allowed to play until it is public.
  • Smurfing is not allowed in any way. PUGs are restricted based on SR to make sure the games are fair and fun. Smurfing in SR restricted PUG events WILL get you perma-banned.
  • If you are participating in PUGs you are expected to behave well, not doing so can result in mutes, suspensions or a ban:
    - Watch your language; swearing is allowed but slurs of any kind are not.
    - Communication is very important and encourged; we have dedicated voice channels on Discord for PUGs, do not scream into your mic however and ensure your mic is setup correctly.
    - Be a team player; picking "meme-heroes" or forcing your team to play around you isn't what PUGs are about. If you want to play attack Torbjorn on Assault there is Quick Play.
    - Being annoyed at times is okay, being tilted is not. PUGs are ment to be a way to improve yourself and have fun without the risk of losing SR.
    - Do not leave games in progress or rage quit. If you have an unstable internet please to refrain from playing PUGs until you have it fixed. Remember there are 11 other players playing with you.

  • When in need of help or when you have a question feel free to ping (@) an online member of PUG staff, do not ping the entire role as this will result in :jaynePing:

Failure to adhere to these rules can results in warnings, suspensions or a ban from all PUGs or even the server.
If you see anyone breaking any rules, you can report this to us by contacting a member of PUG staff or by using the `!report [Discord-tag] [reason]` so we are notified of the situation and can take action.

__**TYPES OF PUGs**__

• __Mixed or Regular PUGs__
These PUGs are open to all players of all SR, players are sorted first by region and later by SR.
• __Tryhard PUGs__
These are open to all players that are Diamond and above.
• __Beginner PUGs__
These are open to all Gold and below players, a hard cap of a season high of 2650 is employed. You must be placed either the current season or last season of competitive. Each team is spectated by a coach that will give advice to the after every game. Note that coaches are volunteers and give feedback to the entire team so do not expect them to only coach you.
• __Reverse Beginner PUGs__
These are open to all Master and above players and can be spectated by Platinum and below players. It gives an opportunity for lower SR players to watch high SR games and ask some questions afterwards to help improve their knowledge of the game.
• __Unofficial PUGs__
These are PUGs that are organized spontanously by members of the community, you are free to start your own games at any time, don't be afraid to talk in chat or hangout in voice to look for people to have some fun with. Note that the rules in these PUGs still apply.

○ __How to Participate__

For every official PUG there will be an announcement posted in #pug-announcements. Jump in the voice channel mentioned in the announcements where a memeber of staff will help you get started. If there is no staff available, check the #pug-announcements channel to see if additional directions have been posted like how the current lobbies have been setup. Otherwise, wait for someone to come pick you up or talk to a member of staff in #pug-general.

Use the #put-your-bnet-here-please channel to post your battletag so the lobby host can invite you. The preferred format is:
`<BATTLE TAG> for <VOICE CHANNEL>`
    e.g.: `Jayne#12340 NA High`

In general staff members will try to run the lobbies, however, sometimes there might not be enough members available to host a lobby. In that case one of the players will be asked to setup the lobby. Please only volunteer to set up a lobby if you are familiar with changing custom game settings.

○ __Lobby Rules__
These are the custom games settings which we use:
  - Competitive rule set
  - Best of 3 on Koth (King of the Hill)
  - Pause on disconnect
  - Skins disabled
  - 12 Spectators


__**SCHEDULE**__
This is the list of offical PUG events and times:

```css
[MON] 2 pm PDT, 5 pm EDT, 23.00 CEST (Reverse Beginner)
[WED] 5 pm PDT, 8 pm EDT, 2.00 CEST (TryHard; Diamond and above)
[FRI] 11 am PDT, 2 pm EDT, 20.00 CEST (European)
[SAT] 1 pm PDT, 4 pm EDT, 22.00 CEST (Regular)

[SUN] 3 pm PDT, 6 pm EDT, 24.00 CEST (Regular)
```


__**PICKING TEAMS**__
Before a match can start, teams need to be drafted and a map needs to be chosen. This process is done by picking two Team Captains first. If there are no volunteers for captains the lobby host will pick two players at will. Team Captains are responsible for assembling balanced teams and picking a map.

○ __Roles__
To make picking teams easier we have a role-icon system. You are required to change your in-game player icon to match what you are intending to play or wish to be playing for that game.
- :Shanghai Dragons: = DPS
- :LosAngelesGladiators: = Main Tank
- :Houston Outlaws: = Tank in general
- :Florida Mayhem: = Support
- :London Spitfire: = Flex
- :Overwatch Logo: = AFK

○ __Rules__
- Players that are not picked in a lobby that has 16 players or less are considered "must-picks" for the next game.
  - This does not apply to official TryHard lobbies due to balance issues.
- Players that join mid draft are not pickable and are not considered to be "must-picks" for the next game.

The picking process during official PUGs is as follows:

```css
[Blue Captain] Bans a map type (Assault, Control, Escort, Hybrid)
[Red Captain] Picks a map type that was not banned
[Blue Captain] Picks two maps from the chosen map type
[Red Captain] Picks a map from the two chosen options
***
[Blue Captain] Picks one player
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks two players
[Blue Captain] Picks two players
[Red Captain] Picks one player
```

Alternatively, we sometimes use the following method which spreads out the responsibility of picking team members:

```css
[Blue Captain] Bans a map type (Assault, Control, Escort, Hybrid)
[Red Captain] Picks a map type that was not banned
[Blue Captain] Picks two maps from the chosen map type
[Red Captain] Picks a map from the two chosen options
***
[Blue Captain] Picks one player
[Red Captain] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Red Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Blue Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Blue Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Red Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Red Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Blue Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Blue Player] Picks one player
[Previous Choosen Red Player] Picks one player
```

As you can see the advantage of being a Captain is that you are guaranteed to play and to pick a map of your choosing.
